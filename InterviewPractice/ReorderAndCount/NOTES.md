Given an array of integers, such as [1, 0, 3, 4, 5, 0, ...],
provide a piece of code that returns the non-zero elements in the array, and reorder
the array with all these non-zero elements to the left, such as [1,3,4,5, X,X,X,X....]
the order of non-zero elements does not matter and the elements on the right of the array do not matter.
